"""
Recording: panel switches -> video files on disk.

Same split as stream.py / inputs.py - this module owns the encoders and their
threads, main.py owns the single UI timer and pushes state in. Nothing here
touches Qt.

WHAT DRIVES IT (inputs.py decodes the pins, this acts on the decode):

    switch 1, red leg, GPIO22 .... START / STOP
    switch 2, green leg, GPIO11 .. PAUSE / RESUME
    button,   GPIO9 .............. SAVE - while rolling, a tap cuts the clip
                                   and keeps rolling; after STOP, HOLDING it
                                   for RECORD_SAVE_HOLD_S (2s) finalizes the
                                   session into RECORD_DIR (/recordings)

WHY IT RE-ENCODES THE DECODED FRAMES rather than copying the RTSP stream with
ffmpeg, which would be nearly free:

  * These cameras are cheap IP units with a small cap on concurrent RTSP
    sessions. A second connection per camera, opened exactly when the operator
    starts recording, is the one moment you cannot afford the viewer to lose its
    picture - and that is the failure it would produce.
  * What lands on disk is then provably what the operator saw, including the
    reconnects. A `-c copy` file and the screen can silently disagree.

The cost is real and budgeted: ~0.4 of a core per 720p camera at RECORD_FPS=15,
on top of the ~0.6 the decode already takes. Two cameras recording is ~2 of the
Pi 4's 4 cores. Drop RECORD_FPS or set RECORD_MAX_WIDTH if that is too tight.

Frames are written on a wall clock, not on stream arrival: one frame per tick
whether or not the camera delivered a new one. An hour of duct run is therefore
an hour of video, and a camera that stalls for 20 s leaves 20 s of held frame
instead of a jump cut that hides the outage. Time in PAUSE is not written at
all, which is what makes pause a cut rather than a freeze.

Exercise it headless, with no switches and no cameras:

    """Builds full_nnn.mp4 - both cameras side by side - AFTER a session is kept.

    This used to be a third live encoder (CombinedView, still below and still
    reachable via RECORD_COMBINED=1). It moved off the recording path because the
    operator asked for the full view at the resolution the cameras actually
    stream, split 50/50, and on this Pi 4 that is not available live at any
    setting - see config.COMBINED_AFTER_SAVE for the measurements.

    Built from the finished per-camera files it is free of all that: the cameras
    are already at native size on disk, all four cores are idle once recording
    has stopped, and a run the operator discarded costs nothing at all because
    this never starts for one.

    GEOMETRY - the fix for the 76/24 split. Each camera gets a half exactly as
    wide as the WIDEST camera and as tall as the TALLEST, and sits centred inside
    it on black. Nothing is scaled, so nothing is softened; nothing is stretched,
    so nothing is distorted; and because both halves are the same box by
    construction the split cannot drift with aspect ratio the way the old
    per-tile sizing did. CAM 1 at 1280x720 beside CAM 2 rotated to 720x1280
    gives a 2560x1280 canvas, 1280 to each.

    ALIGNMENT. The per-camera files do not all start at the same instant - each
    writer opens on its own camera's first frame - so every input is padded at
    the head by its own start skew (CameraRecorder._clip_first_write). Without
    that, SESSION009's measured 1s skew would have put two different moments side
    by side and called it one frame.

    Failure is always non-destructive: the per-camera masters are the record and
    this only ever adds a file. A clip that cannot be built is reported and
    skipped, and the rest of the session still builds.

        # was, and this is why.
        #
        # main.py already sits near 245% on a 4-core Pi while filming - two
        # camera decodes plus two live encodes - so there is about one core of
        # headroom and no more. Normalising a clip in that gap took the load
        # average to 10, and at 2.5x oversubscription everything queues: the UI
        # paint, the 50 Hz joystick frame, the ACK the Uno is waiting for. A
        # video encoder was competing with the drive loop on equal terms.
        #
        # nice 19 and one thread fixes that without giving up the feature. This
        # work is OPPORTUNISTIC - the whole point is that it happens in time the
        # machine is not otherwise using - so it should run only when nothing
        # else wants the core, and it takes longer in exchange. It still finishes
        # far inside the roll interval: at 4x realtime a 120s clip needs ~30s of
        # CPU, and even a quarter of a core clears it in time.
        #
        # The STOP-time pass is left at normal priority deliberately. Nothing is
        # being driven then, the operator is waiting on it, and it should have
        # the machine.
        # THE WHILE-RECORDING PASS RUNS IN THE IDLE CLASS, NOT MERELY NICE.
        #
        # Operator, 2026-09-01: "its lag when video saving process start, video
        # save is finished to its not lagy". Exactly the window this ffmpeg runs
        # in, so nice 19 and an affinity mask were not enough - and the reason is
        # what nice actually means. A nice 19 task is still a NORMAL task: it
        # gets a small share of every core it sits on even while something else
        # wants that core, and a small share of a Pi core is enough to make a
        # 30 Hz repaint miss its slot.
        #
        # SCHED_IDLE is a class BELOW every normal task. It cannot take time from
        # the UI at all; it fills the gaps the UI leaves. That is precisely the
        # bargain this work wants - the encoder runs at about 5x realtime and
        # needs roughly a fifth of the interval, so it can afford to wait for
        # scraps and still finish long before the next clip closes.
        #
        # ionice -c 3 is the same idea for the disk: idle-class I/O, so writing
        # the normalised file cannot hold up a frame being written by the live
        # recorder next to it.
        #
        # THE OPERATOR ASKED WHETHER SHORTER CLIPS WOULD HELP. They would not:
        # the same total work would arrive in more frequent, shorter bursts, so
        # the lag would be chopped up rather than removed - and interrupted every
        # 30s instead of every 60s is worse to drive, not better. The fix has to
        # be that the work yields, not that it is sliced differently.
        #
        # The STOP-time pass keeps normal priority: nothing is being driven then
        # and the operator is waiting on it, so it should have the machine.
