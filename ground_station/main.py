Ground Station — dual RTSP test viewer (PySide6).

A deliberately simple bring-up UI: a status top bar (logo, per-camera chips,
robot link, clock — see topbar.py) over two side-by-side camera panels that
reconnect on their own. No joystick / no command sending yet — this exists
purely to prove both RTSP streams decode on the ground station Pi before you
wire in Steps 5-9 of the guide.

Run:
    python3 main.py
    python3 main.py rtsp://192.168.1.30:8554/cam1 rtsp://192.168.1.30:8554/cam2

On Windows, launch run_ground_station.pyw instead — same app, no console window.

Recording is on the panel switches, not the keyboard (see recorder.py):

    switch 1, GPIO22 ... START / STOP
    switch 2, GPIO11 ... PAUSE / RESUME, inside the same file
    button,   GPIO9 .... SAVE - bank the clip so far and keep rolling

Keys:
    F        fullscreen toggle        S       snapshot both panels
    R        reconnect both           1/2     solo a camera, 0 = both
    Q / Esc  quit
    Space    start/stop  P  pause     Ctrl+S  save clip   (bench only - these
             do nothing while the panel switches are readable)

        # This is the first thing on the panel that distinguishes the two
        # cameras by colour rather than by position, and it is worth saying what

        #
        # THE ARGUMENT AGAINST RED STILL STANDS AND IS WORTH LEAVING WRITTEN
        # DOWN: this panel already spends #e0564a on failure - the disconnected
        # status dot and the NO SIGNAL text - so a red jab is a neighbour of the
        # one colour that means something is wrong, and blue was the one hue
        # here carrying no status meaning at all. It was chosen deliberately,
        # not by accident, and the operator overrode it deliberately too.
        #
        # What keeps it workable is that these two are much hotter and more
        # saturated than either status colour, and they MOVE - a jab that
        # crosses the panel in a second does not read like a dot sitting still.
        # If red on the front ever does get taken for a fault on the rig, this
        # is the line to change, and blue is the option that was already tried.
        #
        # Green on the back is not a go signal either: it means "you are

        the panel answers "which view matters right now" without the operator
        having to think about it.

        WHITE, and around the whole frame rather than just the title strip, on
        the operator's call 2026-08-19: the strip alone was too easy to miss
        while looking at the video itself, which is the one moment it has to be
        readable. The border carries it around the video; the strip going solid
        white is what makes it unmissable in peripheral vision.

        THE BORDER WIDTH DOES NOT CHANGE, and that matters more than it looks:
        the app rule is already 2px (raised from 1px for exactly this), so
        lighting a panel only swaps a COLOUR. Growing the border instead would
        reflow the video by a pixel on every direction change, which reads as
        the picture twitching.

        #panelName is forced dark here because it inherits #d7e0ea from the
        QWidget rule, which is invisible on white. The status dot is NOT touched
        - refresh() sets its colour inline, and an inline sheet on the widget
        itself outranks this one, so it keeps its red/green on the white strip.

        An INLINE stylesheet rather than a dynamic property + unpolish/polish:
        the property route re-polishes the whole widget on every change, which
        at the UI frame rate is a lot of style recomputation for a colour swap.
        Clearing back to "" restores the app-level rules.

        Guarded on no-change because this is called every tick for every panel;
        without the guard Qt would reparse both sheets ~10x a second per camera.
