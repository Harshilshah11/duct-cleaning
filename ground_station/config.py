# 50 ms, down from 200 on 2026-08-31. This is DIRECT LAG: rtspsrc holds the
# picture this long before the decoder ever sees it, so 200 ms was 200 ms of the
# robot's past on screen.
#
# THE NOTE IN stream.py THAT SAID 50 WAS WORSE IS OUT OF DATE, and it is worth
# knowing why rather than just overriding it. That measurement - "latency=50
# drop-on-latency=true (no queue) .... 19.2 fps" - was taken BEFORE the leaky
# queue was added after the decoder. Without a queue a short buffer starves the
# sink and frames are lost; with one, the queue absorbs the jitter the buffer
# used to. Re-measured 2026-08-31 on the current pipeline, at the source rate

#
#   software avdec_h264 .... 25.1 fps, 14.7% system CPU   <-- better on both
#   hardware v4l2h264dec ... 13.7 fps, 20.4% system CPU
#
# The V4L2 M2M decoder hands back NV12 in DMA buffers, and converting those to
# the BGR that OpenCV requires costs more CPU than the software decode ever
# saved - while also halving the frame rate. Software decode of one 720p stream
# is only ~0.6 of a core, so there is nothing to rescue here.
# OFF on 2026-08-31, and this was costing two thirds of the frame rate.
#
# v4l2h264dec is the Pi's hardware H.264 decoder and on paper it is the right
# choice - it should cost less CPU and less latency than avdec_h264 in software.
# Measured on this rig against a live camera, it does neither:
#
#     latency=200  hw=True ....  7.8 fps      hw=False .... 26.3 fps
#     latency=100  hw=True .... 11.5 fps      hw=False .... 26.0 fps
#     latency=50   hw=True ....  8.0 fps      hw=False .... 25.7 fps
#
# A THIRD OF THE SOURCE RATE, at every buffer setting, and GStreamer says why:
# "v4l2h264dec0: 1 initial frames were not dequeued: bug in decoder". The
# element does not hand its frames back cleanly to an appsink, so most of them
# never reach the UI. That is visible as a laggy, stuttering picture rather than
# as an error, which is why it survived so long.
#
# Software decode costs CPU - main.py sits near 190% with two 720p streams - and
# that is the trade being made deliberately: a Pi 4 has four cores and nothing
# else wants them, while dropped frames cannot be bought back.
#
# Worth retrying if the v4l2 stack is ever updated; the measurement above is the
# bar it has to clear.

# screen black above and below the video.
#
#   0.0 ... whole frame, letterboxed (nothing hidden, biggest black bands)
#   0.2 ... 20% of the frame's width is cropped away, picture is 25% taller
#   1.0 ... picture covers the panel completely, ~45% of the width is gone
#
# It is a *crop*, not a zoom out of thin air: whatever this hides, the operator
# never sees. Raise it for a fuller screen, drop it to 0 to see everything the
# camera does.
# Default raised 0.2 -> 1.0 so the picture COVERS its panel with no black bands.
# This matters much more now the cameras are rotated: a 90-degree rotation makes
# the frame portrait inside a landscape panel, and at 0.2 that left roughly half
# the panel black down both sides. Covering crops instead - at 1.0 nothing is
# letterboxed but the parts of the frame outside the panel's aspect are not
# shown. Set VIDEO_ZOOM=0 to see the whole frame again, bands and all.

#
# The cameras are mounted on their sides on this rig, so the default is 90.
# Applied in the capture thread with cv2.rotate (an optimised transpose) rather
# than as a QPainter transform per panel per frame: doing it once at the source
# keeps it off the GUI thread on a Pi that is already software-decoding two
# streams, and means the RECORDER writes the same orientation you are looking
# at. Rotating in the GUI would leave recordings sideways.
#
# 90 and 270 swap width and height, which VIDEO_ZOOM's geometry picks up on its
# own because it reads the frame's real dimensions.
# One value rotates every camera the same way; a comma-separated list sets them
# individually in cameras.txt order, so "180,90" is CAM 1 upside down and CAM 2
# on its side. A short list reuses its last value for the remaining cameras,
# which keeps a single value working when a third camera is added.
# Both cameras re-aimed on the operator's eye, 2026-08-25:
#   CAM 1 FRONT  180 -> 90 -> 0   "3 time right" then "1 time left":
#                                180+270 = 90, then 90-90 = 0
#   CAM 2 BACK    90 ->  0   "rotate 1 time left"  = -90,  and  90- 90 =  0
#
# Note this changes the MERGED view's geometry as well as the screen: full_nnn
# sizes its canvas from the two cameras' dimensions, and rotating one of them by
# a quarter turn swaps its width and height. That is not a fault, but it is why
# the canvas may no longer be the 2560x1280 the recorder's notes describe.

# tiny embedded TCP stack and stop answering *even ARP* under that, which shows
# up as ICMP loss and "host unreachable" - so the retry storm was manufacturing

# HOW OFTEN A RUNNING RECORDING ROLLS TO A NEW CLIP, seconds. 0 disables it and
# restores the old behaviour of one clip per run.
#
# THIS IS WHAT MAKES SAVING FAST, and it is worth knowing why a rollover buys
# anything at all. The recorder writes MPEG-4 while filming because that is the
# only codec cv2 can encode fast enough to keep up - 2.6s per 60 frames against
# 49s for H.264, measured 2026-08-31. Everything then has to be re-encoded to
# H.264 at save time, and that re-encode is the wait: a 100-minute session took
# about 25 minutes, because 90,000 frames is genuinely that much work.
#
# The encoder runs at about 4x realtime, so it can finish a clip long before the
# next one closes and still idle three quarters of the time. Rolling every
# RECORD_SEGMENT_S turns one enormous job at the end into a stream of small ones
# that keep pace with the filming, and leaves only the final partial clip plus
# the join to do at stop.
#
# 60s, on the operator's call after the numbers were measured 2026-08-31:
#
#     encode rate .......... 5.3x realtime
#      60s clip ............ encoded in 11.3s, then 49s idle
#     120s clip ............ encoded in 22.7s, then 97s idle
#
# Both keep up with room to spare, so the only thing the length decides is the
# TAIL - the unfinished clip still to encode when the operator presses stop.
# That is the only wait anyone actually feels, and 60s halves it: about 11
# seconds against 23. The cost is twice as many ffmpeg launches, which is cheap
# now each one is niced and runs on the hardware encoder.
#
# WHY THE ENCODER HAS THE HEADROOM AT ALL, since it is the whole basis of this:
# at 5.3x realtime it is idle about 80% of the time while filming. The old
# design saved that idle capacity up and spent it after the stop; this spends it
# as it goes. Nothing here is faster - the same frames are encoded either way -
# it is only moved off the end of the run, where somebody is waiting.
#
# Do not raise this past the point where a clip takes longer to encode than to
# film. At 5.3x that is far away, but a slower encoder or a busier Pi moves it.

#
# Why a square (operator spec 2026-08-19: "store both camera feed to same
# quality same size ... both in feed same size width and height"). The two
# cameras are mounted 90 degrees apart, so after VIDEO_ROTATE one is 1280x720
# and the other 720x1280. Two pictures cannot be the same width AND the same
# height unless they share an aspect ratio, so one had to be chosen:
#
#   * pad both into a common box - keeps every pixel, but the pictures are
#     still different shapes and the files carry a lot of black;
#   * fit the portrait camera into a landscape frame - drops CAM 2 from 0.92MP
#     to 0.29MP, which is most of the detail on a duct camera;
#   * CROP both to the largest square either can supply - what this is. The
#     pictures come out genuinely identical, 720x720, at native pixel density
#     with nothing scaled or stretched. It costs the left/right edges of the
#     landscape camera and the top/bottom of the portrait one, permanently.
#
# 720 is not arbitrary: it is min(1280, 720), the largest square that fits
# inside both cameras' frames, so neither is ever upscaled to reach it.

#
# Why it cannot be done live. The masters are written by cv2.VideoWriter with
# RECORD_FOURCC, and the only fourcc that keeps up on this Pi is mp4v, which
# exposes no bitrate control whatsoever. Measured here 2026-08-19, both cameras
# at 720x720/15 with the viewer running: avc1 (libx264 in-process) collapsed to
# ~3 fps - 46 frames where mp4v wrote 137 - and left a file with no moov atom.
# Two in-process x264 encoders do not fit beside two decodes and the UI. So the
# live path stays mp4v and the size is fixed offline, on idle cores, exactly the
# way COMBINED_AFTER_SAVE already fixes the full view.

# A CAMERA THAT DROPS OUT PAUSES ITS RECORDING instead of being papered over,
# operator 2026-08-26: "if its camera off to auto paused in saved and when
# recieved to its continue".
#
# What it used to do: hold the last good frame and keep writing it at
# RECORD_FPS, so the file stayed real-time and a 20s dropout became 20s of a
# frozen picture. That is honest about the CLOCK and dishonest about the
# PICTURE, and it spends bitrate on a still.
#
# What it does now: after this many seconds with no new decoded frame, the
# writer stops taking frames. The file stays OPEN and the clip does not roll,
# so when video comes back it continues into the same file - no new clip, no
# gap in the numbering, nothing extra for the merge to join.
#
# THE TRADE, stated plainly: the recording is now shorter than wall-clock by
# whatever the camera missed, and if only ONE camera drops, front.mp4 and
# back.mp4 come out different lengths and no longer line up in time. That is
# the unavoidable cost of not recording the dropout. Set this to 0 to go back
# to frame-holding, which keeps the two files the same length.
#
# The grace period matters: a single late frame is normal on RTSP and must not
# chop the video. One second is several frames' worth of patience.

# the target instead, so two clips of equal length come out equal size.
#
# The cost is real and is the operator's call: at a fixed rate the camera
# looking at more detail gets less of it. 1200k is chosen against measurement -

# Normalising runs on EVERY clip of EVERY camera, so it is the dominant cost of
# a save and the reason the operator reported the merge as too slow. Moving it
# onto the VideoCore leaves the CPU free for the decode side as well, which the
# stopwatch above does not even capture.
#
# THE x264-ONLY FLAGS ARE SKIPPED when this is not libx264 - preset, profile,
# level and -x264-params are x264 spellings and the v4l2m2m wrapper rejects
# them. The CBR bitrate below is what pins the size either way, and it is the
# part that actually matters: it is why two cameras looking at very different
# scenes still produce files of the same length.
#
# SET THIS BACK TO libx264 if the hardware encoder ever produces unplayable
# files - it is a wrapper around a kernel driver and is fussier than x264 about
# odd resolutions. Quality at a fixed bitrate is slightly worse; speed is the
# trade being made.

# The share complaint that produced this ("when i store, file stored file

#
#     cam1_front_001.mp4   mpeg4, Simple Profile, tag mp4v   <- refused
#     cam2_back_001.mp4    mpeg4, Simple Profile, tag mp4v   <- refused
#     full_001.mp4         h264,  Constrained Baseline, avc1 <- shared fine
#
# mp4v is MPEG-4 Part 2, which phones and messaging apps stopped accepting years
# ago; the full view already went out as H.264 because it is built by ffmpeg
# rather than by cv2.VideoWriter. Re-encoding the masters fixes it on its own -
# pinning the profile is what keeps it fixed on the oldest handset likely to be
# handed one of these.
#
# BASELINE, NOT MAIN - round two of the same complaint, 2026-08-20: "the merged
# video was perfect to store and share but single cam was not". Both files were
# H.264 by then, so this time the difference was WHICH H.264:
#
#     full_001.mp4        Constrained Baseline, 0 B-frames, level 3.2  <- shared
#     cam1_front_001.mp4  Main,                 2 B-frames, level 4.0  <- did not
#
# The full view was only Constrained Baseline by accident: COMBINED_PRESET is
# ultrafast, and ultrafast turns CABAC and B-frames off. That accident is the
# configuration that demonstrably travels, so the masters are now pinned to the
# same thing deliberately - and so is the full view, see COMBINED_PROFILE.
#
# B-frames are the expensive part to decode and the part simple players get
# wrong; baseline drops them and CABAC with them. At CBR the file SIZE does not
# move (RECORD_NORM_BITRATE pins it) - what is spent is a little quality at the
# same bitrate, which is a fair price for a file that opens on the first try.

#
# 15 -> 10 on operator spec 2026-08-19: the window only has to outlast the walk

# never consulted. The button's other job - banking a clip mid-run - still
# works, but with the join stage in recorder.py it no longer changes what
# lands on the stick, only where the internal split points are.
#
# THIS IS A DELETING DECISION REVERSED. Any positive value restores the old
# behaviour: a window of that many seconds after STOP in which footage is
# DISCARDED unless claimed by a hold. That was in force earlier the same day;
# it is off now because the operator asked for it, not because it was wrong.
# THE SAVE BUTTON NO LONGER BANKS CLIPS. Operator 2026-08-27: "remove totally
# save button logic in the recording, it make auto save after stop recording".
#
# The gesture was: a tap while rolling closes the current clip and opens the
# next, so an operator could mark something worth keeping without stopping. It
# worked exactly as designed - which was the problem. GPIO25 chatters at about
# four edges a second, and the recorder banked a clip for every one of them:
# session12 collected 565 clips in 676 seconds, session06 168. Each clip then
# needs three ffmpeg stages, so those sessions could never finish processing,
# sat on PROCESSING for ever, and the load they generated is what stopped
# systemd petting the 60-second hardware watchdog and hard-reset the Pi.
#
# So the tap does nothing now. A run is one clip per camera, start to stop, and
# stopping keeps it automatically (RECORD_CONFIRM_S = 0). Set
# RECORD_SAVE_BUTTON=1 to bring the gesture back once the switch is repaired.

# BUILT AFTER THE SAVE, NOT WHILE RECORDING (operator spec 2026-08-19). It used
# to be a third live encoder, and that is what made it wrong on both counts the
# operator complained about:
#
#   * it scaled both cameras to COMBINED_HEIGHT=480, well under the 720 the
#     cameras actually stream, because a live 720 encoder does not fit; and
#   * it gave each camera a width from its OWN aspect ratio, so with CAM 2
#     rotated 90 the tiles came out 852px + 270px - a 76/24 split, measured on
#     /recordings/20260819_143315_SESSION009/full_001.mp4 at 1122x480.
#
# Measured on this Pi 4, a live 50/50 canvas at stream resolution is not
# available at any setting: 2560x1280 encodes at 9.4fps against the 15 it would
# need, the hardware H.264 encoder tops out at 1920x1920 so it cannot help, and
# even 2560x720 leaves only 11% margin on top of two decodes and two encoders.
#
# Building it from the finished per-camera files instead costs NOTHING while
# recording, gets both cameras at their exact native size, and only spends the
# effort on runs the operator actually kept. The tradeoff is that full_nnn.mp4
# appears a beat after the save rather than growing live - the strip reports the
# build so the operator knows it is happening.
# OFF since 2026-08-26, operator's instruction: "not save merge video, remove,

# WHAT TURNING THIS OFF ACTUALLY SKIPS. The per-clip hstack encode - the single
# most expensive stage of a save, because it decodes two streams, scales both
# and encodes a third. Normalising still runs (RECORD_NORMALIZE), so the
# per-camera files are still real h264 that anything can play, and the join
# still reduces them to one file per camera.
#
# So this is not only a file the operator did not want: it is most of the wait
# after a save. Expect the processing to finish in a fraction of the time it
# took while the side-by-side was being built.
#
# Set back to 1 to get full.mp4 again. Nothing else has to change - the join
