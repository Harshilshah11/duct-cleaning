USB chooser - the popup that opens when a stick is plugged in.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 2026-08-26 a stick triggered usb_backup.py to mirror
/recordings and then DELETE it from the Pi, with no way to intervene. The
operator asked for the choice back: a stick now mounts and waits, and nothing
moves until SAVE or DELETE is pressed here.

WHAT IT IS NOT. It does not mount anything. Mounting needs root and the viewer
does not have it, so usb_backup.py still owns finding, mounting and publishing
the stick - it simply stops copying. This reads `mount` out of that published
status and does the file work as arnobot.

THREADED, BECAUSE COPYING IS SLOW. A 60 MB session onto a FAT stick is seconds,
and doing it on the UI thread would freeze the video panels for all of them -
which on this rig is indistinguishable from the crash we spent an evening on.
The worker owns the filesystem; the dialog only ever reads its progress.

# other surface in the rig is a live readout you glance at while driving, so
# they are light, flat and quiet. This one is a file manager - it appears only
# when a stick is plugged in, it takes the operator's full attention, and it
# performs irreversible deletions. Dropping the whole panel to near-black is
# what says "you have stopped driving and you are now moving files".
#
# The values are theme.DARK, which is already Apple's dark system palette -
# same blue, same red, same label tiers. The only literals here are the three
# window-chrome tones and the traffic lights, which have no equivalent in a
# palette built for a light UI.

# "copy popup and delete confirm popup is very light so make it some dark", with

#
# The light sheets came from an earlier ask - the two popups had both been the
# same near-black as the window and were indistinguishable, so they were made
# pale to read as raised. Pale solved the separation and overshot the brightness:
# against a near-black file manager on a screen used in a duct, a white slab is
# what the operator is now objecting to.
#
# WINDOWS 11 SOLVES THE SAME PROBLEM WITHOUT GOING LIGHT. Its copy dialog is a
# raised DARK surface - a step or two above the window, never below it - with a
# hairline rim, a thin accent progress bar and one muted line of detail under it.
# Elevation is carried by the rim and the step in value, not by inverting.
#
# Still TINTED APART BY WHAT THEY DO, because that ask has not gone away and the
# reason behind it holds - the destructive one must not look like the harmless
# one at a glance. The tint is now carried in a dark ground rather than a pale

        Operator 2026-09-02: "when i select delete all to all delete, also
        processing video which is not done in usb".

        This used to delete only the "ready" rows and announce that the rest were
        being left alone. That guard was written for a session with a merge
        actually in flight, where deleting underneath the worker would take the
        job down - but "processing" also covers a session that can never finish:
        a run cut by a power failure leaves parts with no moov index, nothing can
        join them, and the row sits there for ever. Delete All that cannot delete
        those is a Delete All that leaves the card full.

        THE ONE THING STILL PROTECTED IS A LIVE RUN. Anything written to inside
        LIVE_GRACE_S is assumed to be recording right now and is skipped - the
        chooser cannot see SessionManager to ask, so recent writes are the
        available proxy, and the same test guards the recovery sweep in
        recorder.py for the same reason.

        THIS USED TO WAIT 15 SECONDS. The intent was sound - a copy in flight
        owns files on both sides, and letting it finish beats leaving half a
        session on the stick. But it waited without ever ASKING the worker to
        stop, and the worker only checks its stop flag BETWEEN jobs, never
        during a file copy.

        So pulling the stick mid-copy left the worker blocked on I/O to a device
        that no longer existed, while the UI thread sat inside wait() doing
        nothing. The whole frontend stopped for fifteen seconds, and longer if
        the I/O never returned at all - which is the "remove USB without exit
        and the frontend freezes" report. A stick that has physically gone is
        exactly the case where waiting for the copy cannot help: there is
        nothing left to finish writing to.

        So: ask it to stop, give it a short grace in case it is between files,
        and if it is still stuck, abandon it with its signals cut so it cannot
        call back into a window that is being destroyed.
